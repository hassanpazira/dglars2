Title: 
Extended Differential Geometric LARS (dgLARS) for the exponential dispersion family GLMs with a new algorithm.

Description: 
dglars2 fits the differential geometric extension of the least angle regression method for logistic, Gamma and Inverse-Gaussian regression models. To compute the implicitly defined solution curve, two almost different algorithms are implemented, i.e. the predictor-corrector (PC) method and the improved predictor-corrector (IPC) method, as described in the paper: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-017-9761-7.
