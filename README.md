Description: dglars2 fits the differential geometric extension of 
        the least angle regression method for logistic, Gamma and 
        Inverse-Gaussian regression models. To compute the implicitly
        defined solution curve, two almost different algorithms are 
        implemented, i.e. the predictor-corrector (PC) method and the
        improved predictor-corrector (IPC) method, as described in 
        the paper linked to via the URL below.
